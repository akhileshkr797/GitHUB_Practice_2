    <h3>Electron GitHub Example</h3>
    <p>
        I have the same problem with a 3rd-party site my Electron shell has to run--the actual blob is buried to where I can't capture the URL and use the method I would normally employ (download PDF and put it in a queue folder), so I'm depending on Electron
        to step in. The pop-up <object> tag just shows "can't load plugin" and we stop there. Seems to work in Chrome, and probably in raw Chromium but I don't have any live data with which to test that assumption right now.
        I've spent the last 9 months working on this product and right now an international airport and a national airline are waiting for results. Admittedly, their printing method is a bit Byzantine, but if Chrome can handle it--why can't an Electron-based app?
